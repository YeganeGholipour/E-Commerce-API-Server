# **E-Commerce Order Management API**  

## **Overview**  
This is a Django REST Framework (DRF) API for managing orders and shipping in an e-commerce system. The API supports order creation, retrieval, updates, payment handling, order cancellations, and shipping management for both users and admins.  

## **Features**  

### **User Features**  
- **Create an Order**: Users can create new orders linked to their cart.  
- **View Orders**: Users can retrieve and list their own orders.  
- **Update an Order**: Users can update their orders, including modifying the shipping details.  
- **Successful Payment**: Users can mark an order as paid.  
- **Cancel an Order**: Users can cancel an order (instead of deleting it).  
- **View Shipping Details**: Users can retrieve and list their shipping details for orders they own.  

### **Admin Features**  
- **View All Orders**: Admins can list and retrieve any order.  
- **Ship an Order**: Admins can mark an order as ‚ÄúShipped‚Äù (only if the payment is successful).

- **View Shipping Details**: Admins can list and retrieve all shipping details.  

## **Models**  

### **Order Model**
